This includes a one-time capital infusion to the Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency (IREDA) and the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) amounting to INR 2,500 crore (USD 0.3 billion) to increase their operations in the renewable sector.Subsidies to renewables peaked in FY 17 at 41% above FY 22 levels (INR 16,312 crore, or USD 2.2 billion) but fell in response to policy uncertainty. This uncertainty was due to the ending of the first tranche of subsidies under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (national program);",

      "description":"The post-COVID-19 economic resurgence was evident in the increased uptake of EVs, and an associated uptick in EV subsidies. In 2021, electric vehicles (EVs) accounted for 1.1% of total vehicle sales but this share is expected to reach 39% by 2027. Around 95% of EVs registered in 2021 were two- and three-wheelers.The main EV subsidy program is the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles scheme, which paid out a record high (for the program) of INR 800 crore (USD 0.1 billion) in FY 22. But the majority of the program’s INR 10,000 crore (USD 1.3 billion) funds allocated in FY 20 were unspent by end FY 22 and the program has been extended to FY 24, using existing funds. Other major EV subsidies were GST concessions on vehicle sales.",

But they remain more than four times the subsidies for renewables and EVs at INR 13,887 crore (USD 1.9 billion). Continued support for fossil fuels is out of step with India’s energy access, energy security, and climate change objectives.",

      "description":"Subsidies to oil and gas in FY 22 were substantial, totalling INR 44,383 crore (USD 5.9 billion), primarily subsidies to domestic liquefied petroleum gas (LPG): preferential GST rates and losses by India’s state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) due to fixed LPG pricing. The Center committed to reimbursing OMCs for their losses on sales of domestic LPG between June 2020 and June 2022, with a bailout of INR 22,000 crore (USD 3 billion). While LPG subsidies were sizable in FY 22, they were lower than those provided in FY 21. Total oil and gas subsidies fell from FY 21 to FY 22 due to a reduction in funding for two consumer LPG programs: the Direct Benefit Transfer-LPG (DBTL, also known as Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh, PAHAL) and the Ujjwala (LPG connections for the poor) schemes.",

      "description":"Government subsidies for coal amounted to INR 15,933 in FY 22 (USD 2.1 billion), largely due to GST concessions on coal sales. Coal subsidies remained relatively unchanged from FY 18 to FY 22. However, the prices set in consultation with the Central Government for domestically produced coal have not been raised in 4 years, despite rising international coal prices and input costs, such as diesel. Coal India Limited, which mines over 80% of domestic coal, has sought to raise coal prices, but government shareholders were reluctant to do so during a period of high inflation. Meanwhile, spot market prices were 150% above regulated prices. This has capped input costs for thermal power generation, but we were unable to quantify this price support.",

      "description":"The largest subsidy for electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) was below-cost electricity pricing to support consumers, funded through state government subsidies to power distribution companies (DISCOMs: for more detail see Unpacking India’s Electricity Subsidies). T&D subsidies remained about the same as FY 22 and consistent with the FY 17 to FY 22 average of INR 131,000 crore (USD 17.6 billion) per year. This indicates that, despite schemes to reform subsidies, progress has been slow.  ",
